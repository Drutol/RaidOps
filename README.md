# RaidOps
## Welcome!

This repo contains RaidOps addons , issue tracker and wiki are here for you to enjoy.
Check out wiki for full info.(https://github.com/Mordonus/RaidOps/wiki)

## What this addon does?

It does basically 3 things:

- [x] EPGP Management*.
- [x] Extended Loot Distribution System aka "Network Bidding".
- [x] Enhancements to Carbine's Master Loot Addon.

DKP is still there but it's no longer emphasized.

EPGP management is the core functionality with the most deep to it while the other two are smaller modules focused strictly on one thing.
